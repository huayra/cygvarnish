.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishncsa utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs and
presents them in the Apache / NCSA "combined" log format.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
When writing to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.
.TP
.B \-b
Include log entries which result from communication with a
backend server.  If neither \-b nor \-c is
specified, varnishncsa acts as if they both were.
.TP
.B \-C
Ignore case when matching regular expressions.
.TP
.B \-c
Include log entries which result from communication
with a client.  If neither \-b nor \-c is specified,
varnishncsa acts as if they both were.
.TP
.B \-D
Daemonize.
.TP
.B \-d
Process old log entries on startup.  Normally, varnishncsa
will only process entries which are written to the log
after it starts.
.TP
.B \-f
Prefer the X\-Forwarded\-For HTTP header over client.ip in
the log output.
.TP
.BI \-F \ format
Specify the log format used. If no format is specified the
default log format is used. Currently it is:
.sp
%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b "%{Referer}i" "%{User\-agent}i"
.sp
Supported formatters are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B %b
Size of response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers.
In CLF format, i.e. a \(aq\-\(aq rather than a 0 when no
bytes are sent.
.TP
.B %H
The request protocol. Defaults to HTTP/1.0 if not
known.
.TP
.B %h
Remote host. Defaults to \(aq\-\(aq if not known.
Defaults to 127.0.0.1 for backend requests.
.TP
.B %{X}i
The contents of request header line X.
.TP
.B %l
Remote logname (always \(aq\-\(aq)
.TP
.B %m
Request method. Defaults to \(aq\-\(aq if not known.
.TP
.B %q
The query string, if no query string exists, an
empty string.
.TP
.B %{X}o
The contents of response header line X.
.TP
.B %r
The first line of the request. Synthesized from other
fields, so it may not be the request verbatim.
.TP
.B %s
Status sent to the client
.TP
.B %t
Time when the request was received, in HTTP date/time
format.
.TP
.B %U
The request URL without any query string. Defaults to
\(aq\-\(aq if not known.
.TP
.B %u
Remote user from auth
.TP
.B %{X}x
Extended variables.  Supported variables are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Varnish:time_firstbyte
Time to the first byte from the backend arrived
.TP
.B Varnish:hitmiss
Whether the request was a cache hit or miss. Pipe
and pass are considered misses.
.TP
.B Varnish:handling
How the request was handled, whether it was a
cache hit, miss, pass, pipe or error.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m \fI\%tag:regex\fP only list records where tag matches regex. Multiple
\-m options are AND\-ed together.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n
Specifies the name of the varnishd instance to get logs
from.  If \-n is not specified, the host name is used.
.TP
.BI \-P \ file
Write the process\(aqs PID to the specified file.
.TP
.BI \-r \ file
Read log entries from file instead of shared memory.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version number and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w \ file
Write log entries to file instead of displaying them.
The file will be overwritten unless the \-a
option was specified.
.sp
If varnishncsa receives a SIGHUP while writing to a file,
it will reopen the file, allowing the old one to be
rotated away.
.TP
.BI \-X \ regex
Exclude log entries which match the specified
regular expression.
.TP
.BI \-x \ tag
Exclude log entries with the specified tag.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the \-o option was specified, a tag and a regex argument must be given.
varnishncsa will then only log for request groups which include that tag
and the regular expression matches on that tag.
