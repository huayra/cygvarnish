.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishd daemon accepts HTTP requests from clients, passes them on to a backend server and caches the
returned documents to better satisfy future requests for the same document.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a address[:port][,address[:port][...]
.
Listen for client requests on the specified address and port.  The address can be a host
name (“localhost”), an IPv4 dotted\-quad (“127.0.0.1”), or an IPv6 address enclosed in
square brackets (“[::1]”).  If address is not specified, varnishd will listen on all
available IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces.  If port is not specified, the default HTTP port as
listed in /etc/services is used.  Multiple listening addresses and ports can be speci‐
fied as a whitespace\- or comma\-separated list.
.TP
.B \-b host[:port]
.
Use the specified host as backend server.  If port is not specified,
the default is 8080.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C
.
Print VCL code compiled to C language and exit. Specify the VCL file
to compile with the \-f option.
.TP
.B \-d
.
Enables debugging mode: The parent process runs in the foreground with a CLI connection
on stdin/stdout, and the child process must be started explicitly with a CLI command.
Terminating the parent process will also terminate the child.
.TP
.B \-F
.
Run in the foreground.
.TP
.BI \-f \ config
.
Use the specified VCL configuration file instead of the
builtin default.  See vcl(7) for details on VCL
syntax. When no configuration is supplied varnishd will
not start the cache process.
.TP
.BI \-g \ group
.
Specifies the name of an unprivileged group to which the child process should switch
before it starts accepting connections.  This is a shortcut for specifying the group
run\-time parameter.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h type[,options]
.
Specifies the hash algorithm.  See Hash Algorithms for a list of supported algorithms.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-i \ identity
.
Specify the identity of the varnish server.  This can be accessed using server.identity
from VCL
.TP
.BI \-l \ shmlogsize
.
Specify size of shmlog file.  Scaling suffixes like \(aqk\(aq, \(aqm\(aq can be used up to
(e)tabytes.  Default is 80 Megabytes.  Specifying less than 8 Megabytes is unwise.
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
.
Specify a name for this instance.  Amonst other things, this name is used to construct
the name of the directory in which varnishd keeps temporary files and persistent state.
If the specified name begins with a forward slash, it is interpreted as the absolute
path to the directory which should be used for this purpose.
.TP
.BI \-P \ file
.
Write the process\(aqs PID to the specified file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p param=value
.
Set the parameter specified by param to the specified value.  See Run\-Time
Parameters for a list of parameters. This option can be used multiple
times to specify multiple parameters.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-S \ file
.
Path to a file containing a secret used for authorizing access to the management port.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s [name=]type[,options]
.
Use the specified storage backend.  See Storage Types for a list of supported storage
types.  This option can be used multiple times to specify multiple storage files. You
can name the different backends. Varnish will then reference that backend with the
given name in logs, statistics, etc.
.TP
.B \-T address[:port]
.
Offer a management interface on the specified address and port.  See Management
Interface for a list of management commands.
.TP
.B \-M address:port
.
Connect to this port and offer the command line
interface. Think of it as a reverse shell. When running with
\-M and there is no backend defined the child process (the cache)
will not start initially.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-t \ ttl
.
Specifies a hard minimum time to live for cached
documents.  This is a shortcut for specifying the
default_ttl run\-time parameter.
.TP
.BI \-u \ user
.
Specifies the name of an unprivileged user to which the child
process should switch before it starts accepting
connections.  This is a shortcut for specifying the user
run\- time parameter.
.sp
If specifying both a user and a group, the user should be
specified first.
.TP
.B \-V
.
Display the version number and exit.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-w min[,max[,timeout]]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
Start at least min but no more than max worker threads
with the specified idle timeout.  This is a shortcut for
specifying the thread_pool_min, thread_pool_max and
thread_pool_timeout run\-time parameters.
.sp
If only one number is specified, thread_pool_min and
thread_pool_max are both set to this number, and
thread_pool_timeout has no effect.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Hash Algorithms
.sp
The following hash algorithms are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B simple_list
.
A simple doubly\-linked list.  Not recommended for production use.
.TP
.B classic[,buckets]
.
A standard hash table.  This is the default.  The hash key is the
CRC32 of the object\(aqs URL modulo the size of the hash table.  Each
table entry points to a list of elements which share the same hash
key. The buckets parameter specifies the number of entries in the
hash table.  The default is 16383.
.TP
.B critbit
.
A self\-scaling tree structure. The default hash algorithm in 2.1. In
comparison to a more traditional B tree the critbit tree is almost
completely lockless.
.UNINDENT
.SS Storage Types
.sp
The following storage types are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B malloc[,size]
.
Storage for each object is allocated with malloc(3).
.sp
The size parameter specifies the maximum amount of memory varnishd will allocate.  The size is assumed to
be in bytes, unless followed by one of the following suffixes:
.sp
K, k    The size is expressed in kibibytes.
.sp
M, m    The size is expressed in mebibytes.
.sp
G, g    The size is expressed in gibibytes.
.sp
T, t    The size is expressed in tebibytes.
.sp
The default size is unlimited.
.TP
.B file[,path[,size[,granularity]]]
.
Storage for each object is allocated from an arena backed by a file.  This is the default.
.sp
The path parameter specifies either the path to the backing file or the path to a directory in which
varnishd will create the backing file.  The default is /tmp.
.sp
The size parameter specifies the size of the backing file.  The size is assumed to be in bytes, unless fol‐
lowed by one of the following suffixes:
.sp
K, k    The size is expressed in kibibytes.
.sp
M, m    The size is expressed in mebibytes.
.sp
G, g    The size is expressed in gibibytes.
.sp
T, t    The size is expressed in tebibytes.
.sp
%       The size is expressed as a percentage of the free space on the file system where it resides.
.sp
The default size is 50%.
.sp
If the backing file already exists, it will be truncated or expanded to the specified size.
.sp
Note that if varnishd has to create or expand the file, it will not pre\-allocate the added space, leading
to fragmentation, which may adversely impact performance.  Pre\-creating the storage file using dd(1) will
reduce fragmentation to a minimum.
.sp
The granularity parameter specifies the granularity of allocation.  All allocations are rounded up to this
size.  The size is assumed to be in bytes, unless followed by one of the suffixes described for size except
for %.
.sp
The default size is the VM page size.  The size should be reduced if you have many small objects.
.UNINDENT
.sp
persistent,path,size {experimental}
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
Persistent storage. Varnish will store objects in a file in a
manner that will secure the survival of \fImost\fP of the objects in
the event of a planned or unplanned shutdown of Varnish.
.sp
The path parameter specifies the path to the backing file. If
the file doesn\(aqt exist Varnish will create it.
.sp
The size parameter specifies the size of the backing file.  The
size is assumed to be in bytes, unless followed by one of the
following suffixes:
.sp
K, k    The size is expressed in kibibytes.
.sp
M, m    The size is expressed in mebibytes.
.sp
G, g    The size is expressed in gibibytes.
.sp
T, t    The size is expressed in tebibytes.
.sp
Varnish will split the file into logical \fIsilos\fP and write to
the silos in the manner of a circular buffer. Only one silo will
be kept open at any given point in time. Full silos are
\fIsealed\fP. When Varnish starts after a shutdown it will discard
the content of any silo that isn\(aqt sealed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Transient Storage
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
If you name any of your storage backend "Transient" it will be
used for transient (short lived) objects. By default Varnish
would use an unlimited malloc backend for this.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Management Interface
.sp
If the \-T option was specified, varnishd will offer a command\-line management interface on the specified address
and port.  The recommended way of connecting to the command\-line management interface is through varnishadm(1).
.sp
The commands available are documented in varnish(7).
.SS Run\-Time Parameters

.
Default: 50
.IP \(bu 2
.
Flags: experimental
.UNINDENT
.sp
How long time the workerthread lingers on the session to see if a new request appears right away.
If sessions are reused, as much as half of all reuses happen within the first 100 msec of the previous request completing.
Setting this too high results in worker threads not doing anything for their keep, setting it too low just means that more sessions take a detour around the waiter.
.TP
.B session_max
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Units: sessions
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 100000
.UNINDENT
.sp
Maximum number of sessions we will allocate before just dropping connections.
This is mostly an anti\-DoS measure, and setting it plenty high should not hurt, as long as you have the memory for it.
.TP

.
Default: 8192
.IP \(bu 2
.
Flags: delayed
.UNINDENT
.sp
Bytes of shmlog workspace allocated for worker threads. If too big, it wastes some ram, if too small it causes needless flushes of the SHM workspace.
These flushes show up in stats as "SHM flushes due to overflow".
Minimum is 4096 bytes.
.TP
.B shortlived
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2

.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Units: milliseconds
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 2
.UNINDENT
.sp
Wait at least this long between creating threads.
.sp
Setting this too long results in insuffient worker threads.
.sp
Setting this too short increases the risk of worker thread pile\-up.
.TP
.B thread_pool_add_threshold
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Units: requests
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 2
.IP \(bu 2
.
Flags: experimental
.UNINDENT
.sp
Overflow threshold for worker thread creation.
.sp
Setting this too low, will result in excess worker threads, which is generally a bad idea.
.sp
Setting it too high results in insuffient worker threads.
.TP
.B thread_pool_fail_delay
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Units: milliseconds
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 200
.IP \(bu 2
.
Flags: experimental
.UNINDENT
.sp
Wait at least this long after a failed thread creation before trying to create another thread.
.sp
Failure to create a worker thread is often a sign that  the end is near, because the process is running out of RAM resources for thread stacks.
This delay tries to not rush it on needlessly.
.sp
If thread creation failures are a problem, check that thread_pool_max is not too high.
.sp
It may also help to increase thread_pool_timeout and thread_pool_min, to reduce the rate at which treads are destroyed and later recreated.
.TP
.B thread_pool_max
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Units: threads
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 500
.IP \(bu 2
.
Flags: delayed, experimental
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum number of worker threads in each pool.
.sp
Do not set this higher than you have to, since excess worker threads soak up RAM and CPU and generally just get in the way of getting work done.
.TP
.B thread_pool_min
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Units: threads
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 5
.IP \(bu 2

.
Units: pools
.IP \(bu 2
.
Default: 2
.IP \(bu 2
.
Flags: delayed, experimental
.UNINDENT
.sp
Number of worker thread pools.
.sp
Increasing number of worker pools decreases lock contention.
.sp
Too many pools waste CPU and RAM resources, and more than one pool for each CPU is probably detrimal to performance.
.sp
Can be increased on the fly, but decreases require a restart to take effect.
.TP
.B thread_stats_rate
