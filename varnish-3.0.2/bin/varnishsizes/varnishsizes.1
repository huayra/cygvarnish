.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishsizes utility reads varnishd(1) shared memory logs and presents
a continuously updated histogram showing the distribution of the last N
requests by their processing.  The value of N and the vertical scale are
displayed in the top left corner.  The horizontal scale is a logarithmic
representation of bytes.  Hits are marked with a pipe character
("|"), and misses are marked with a hash character ("#").
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b
.
Include log entries which result from communication with a backend server.
If neither \-b nor \-c is specified, varnishsizes acts as if they both were.
.TP
.B \-C
.
Ignore case when matching regular expressions.
.TP
.B \-c
.
Include log entries which result from communication with a client.
If neither \-b nor \-c is specified, varnishsizes acts as if they both were.
.TP
.B \-d
.
Process old log entries on startup.  Normally, varnishsizes will only
process entries which are written to the log after it starts.
.TP
.BI \-I \ regex
.
Include log entries which match the specified regular expression.
If neither \-I nor \-i is specified, all log entries are included.
.TP
.BI \-i \ tag
.
Include log entries with the specified tag.  If neither \-I nor \-i
is specified, all log entries are included.

.TP
.B \-V
.
Display the version number and exit.
.TP
.BI \-w \ delay
