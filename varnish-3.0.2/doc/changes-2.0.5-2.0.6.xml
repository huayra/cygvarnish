      <para>2.0.5 had an off-by-one error in the ESI handling causing
      includes to fail a large part of the time. This has now been
      fixed.</para>

      <para>Try harder to not confuse backends when sending them
      backend probes.  We half-closed the connection, something some
      backends thought meant we had dropped the connection.  Stop
      doing so, and add the capability for specifying the expected
      response code.</para>

    <change type="bug">
      <para>In 2.0.5, session lingering was turned on.  This caused
      statistics to not be counted often enough in some cases.  This
      has now been fixed.</para>

      <para>Avoid triggering an assert if the other end closes the
      connection while we are lingering and waiting for another

      <para>When generating backtraces, prefer the built-in backtrace

      on Solaris.</para>
