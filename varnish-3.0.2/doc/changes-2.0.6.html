    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.0.6</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.0.5 and 2.0.6</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>2.0.5 had an off-by-one error in the ESI handling causing
      includes to fail a large part of the time. This has now been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try harder to not confuse backends when sending them
      backend probes.  We half-closed the connection, something some
      backends thought meant we had dropped the connection.  Stop
      doing so, and add the capability for specifying the expected
      response code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In 2.0.5, session lingering was turned on.  This caused
      statistics to not be counted often enough in some cases.  This
      has now been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Avoid triggering an assert if the other end closes the
      connection while we are lingering and waiting for another
      request from them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When generating backtraces, prefer the built-in backtrace
      function if such exists.  This fixes a problem compiling 2.0.5
      on Solaris.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make it possible to specify the per-thread stack size.
      This might be useful on 32 bit systems with their limited
      address space.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Document the <span class="code">-C</span> option
      to <span class="code">varnishd</span>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
