    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.1</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.0.6 and 2.1.0</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Persistent storage is now experimentally supported using
      the <span class="code">persistent</span> stevedore.  It has the same command
      line arguments as the file stevedore.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">obj.*</span> is now called <span class="code">beresp.*</span>
      in <span class="code">vcl_fetch</span>, and <span class="code">obj.*</span> is now
      read-only.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The regular expression engine is now PCRE instead of POSIX
      regular expressions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">req.*</span> is now available
      in <span class="code">vcl_deliver</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add saint mode where we can attempt to grace an object if
	we don't like the backend response for some reason.</p>
        <p>Related, add <span class="code">saintmode_threshold</span> which is the
	threshold for the number of objects to be added to the trouble
	list before the backend is considered sick.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a new hashing method called critbit.  This autoscales
      and should work better on large object workloads than the
      classic hash.  Critbit has been made the default hash algorithm.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When closing connections, we experimented with sending RST
      to free up load balancers and free up threads more quickly.
      This caused some problems with NAT routers and so has been
      reverted for now.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add thread that checks objects against ban list in order
	to prevent ban list from growing forever.  Note that this
	needs purges to be written so they don't depend
	on <span class="code">req.*</span>.  Enabled by
	setting <span class="code">ban_lurker_sleep</span> to a nonzero
	value.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The shared memory log file format was limited to maximum
      64k simultaneous connections.  This is now a 32 bit field which
      removes this limitation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove obj_workspace, this is now sized automatically.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename acceptors to waiters</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">vcl_prefetch</span> has been removed.  It was never
      fully implemented.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add support for authenticating CLI connections.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add hash director that chooses which backend to use
      depending on <span class="code">req.hash</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add client director that chooses which backend to use
      depending on the client's IP address.  Note that this ignores
      the <span class="code">X-Forwarded-For</span> header.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishd</span> now displays a banner by default
      when you connect to the CLI.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Increase performance somewhat by moving statistics
	gathering into a per-worker structure that is regularly
	flushed to the global stats.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure we store the header and body of object together.
	This may in some cases improve performance and is needed for
	persistence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove client-side address accounting.  It was never used
      for anything and presented a performance problem.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a timestamp to bans, so you can know how old they are.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Quite a few people got confused over the warning about not
	being able to lock the shared memory log into RAM, so stop
	warning about that.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Change the default CLI timeout to 10 seconds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We previously forced all inserts into the cache to be GET
	requests.  This has been changed to allow POST as well in
	order to be able to implement purge-on-POST semantics.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The CLI command <span class="code">stats</span> now only lists non-zero
	values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The CLI command <span class="code">stats</span> now only lists non-zero
	values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use <span class="code">daemon(3)</span> from <span class="code">libcompat</span> on
	Darwin.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove <span class="code">vcl_discard</span> as it causes too much
	complexity and never actually worked particularly well.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove <span class="code">vcl_timeout</span> as it causes too much
	complexity and never actually worked particularly well.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Update the documentation so it refers
      to <span class="code">sess_workspace</span>, not <span class="code">http_workspace</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Document the <span class="code">-i</span> switch
      to <span class="code">varnishd</span> as well as
      the <span class="code">server.identity</span>
      and <span class="code">server.hostname</span> VCL variables.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">purge.hash</span> is now deprecated and no longer
      shown in help listings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When processing ESI, replace the five mandatory XML
      entities when we encounter them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add string representations of time and relative
	time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add locking for <span class="code">n_vbe_conn</span> to make it stop
      underflowing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When ESI-processing content, check for illegal XML
      character entities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish can now connect its CLI to a remote instance when
      starting up, rather than just being connected to.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is no longer needed to specify the maximum number of
	HTTP headers to allow from backends.  This is now a run-time
	parameter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <span class="code">X-Forwarded-For</span> header is now generated
      by <span class="code">vcl_recv</span> rather than the C code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is now possible to not send all CLI traffic to
	syslog.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is now possible to not send all CLI traffic to
	syslog.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the case of varnish crashing, it now outputs a
      identifying string with the OS, OS revision, architecture and
      storage parameters together with the backtrace.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use exponential backoff when we run out of file
	descriptors or sessions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allow setting backend timeouts to zero.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Count uptime in the shared memory log.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try to detect the case of two running varnishes with the
      same shmlog and storage by writing the master and child process
      ids to the shmlog and refusing to start if they are still
      running.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure to use EOF mode when serving ESI content to
	HTTP/1.0 clients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure we close the connection if it either
	sends <span class="code">Connection: close</span> or it is a HTTP/1.0
	backend that does not send <span class="code">Connection:
	keep-alive</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Increase the default session workspace to 64k on 64-bit
	systems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make the <span class="code">epoll</span> waiter use level triggering,
      not edge triggering as edge triggering caused problems on very
      busy servers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Handle unforeseen client disconnections better on Solaris.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make session lingering apply to new sessions, not just
      reused sessions.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishstat</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Make use of the new uptime field in the shared memory log
      rather than synthesizing it from the start time.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishlog</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Exit at the end of the file when started
	with <span class="code">-d</span>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishadm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishadm</span> can now have a timeout when trying
      to connect to the running <span class="code">varnishd</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishadm</span> now knows how to respond to the
      secret from a secured <span class="code">varnishd</span></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
