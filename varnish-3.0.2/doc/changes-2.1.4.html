    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.1.4</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.1.3 and 2.1.4</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>An embarrasing typo in the new binary heap layout caused
      inflated obj/objcore/objhdr counts and could cause odd problems
      when the LRU expunge mechanism was invoked.  This has been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We now have updated documentation in the reStructuredText
      format.  Manual pages and reference documentation are both built
      from this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We now include a DNS director which uses DNS for choosing
      which backend to route requests to.  Please see the
      documentation for more details.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you restarted a request, the HTTP header
      <span class="code">X-Forwarded-For</span> would be updated multiple times.
      This has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If a VCL contained a % sign, and the <span class="code">vcl.show</span>
      CLI command was used, varnishd would crash.  This has been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When doing a pass operation, we would remove the
      <span class="code">Content-Length</span>, <span class="code">Age</span> and
      <span class="code">Proxy-Auth</span> headers.  We are no longer doing
      this.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">now</span> has a string representation, making it
      easier to construct <span class="code">Expires</span> headers in VCL.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In a high traffic environment, we would sometimes reuse a
      file descriptor before flushing the logs from a worker thread to
      the shared log buffer.  This would cause confusion in some of
      the tools.  This has been fixed by explicitly flushing the log
      when a backend connection is closed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the communication between the management and the child
      process gets out of sync, we have no way to recover.
      Previously, <span class="code">varnishd</span> would be confused, but we now
      just kill the child and restart it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the backend closes the connection on us just as we sent
      a request to it, we retry the request.  This should solve some
      interoperability problems with Apache and the mpm-itk multi
      processing module.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishd</span> now only provides help output the
      current CLI session is authenticated for.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the backend does not tell us which length indication it
      is using, we now assume the resource ends EOF at.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The client director now has a variable
      <span class="code">client.identity</span> which is used to choose which
      backend should receive a given request.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Solaris <span class="code">port</span> waiter has been updated, and
      other portability fixes for Solaris.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There was a corner case in the close-down processing of pipes, this has now been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Previously, if we stopped polling a backend which was
      sick, it never got marked as healthy.  This has now been
      changed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is now possible to specify ports as part of the <span class="code">.host</span> field in VCL.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The synthetic counters were not locked properly, and so
      the <span class="code">sms_</span> counters could underflow.  This has now
      been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The value of <span class="code">obj.status</span> as a string in vcl_error would not be correct in all cases.  This has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish would try to trim storage segments completely
      filled when using the malloc stevedore and the object was
      received chunked encoding.  This has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If a buggy backend sends us a <span class="code">Vary</span> header
      with two colons, we would previously abort.  We now rather fix
      this up and ignore the extra colon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">req.hash_always_miss</span> and
      <span class="code">req.hash_ignore_busy</span> has been added, to make
      preloading or periodically refreshing content work better.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishncsa</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishncsa</span> would in some cases be confused
      by ESI requests and output invalid lines.  This has now been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishlog</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishlog</span> now allows <span class="code">-o</span> and <span class="code">-u</span> together.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishtop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishtop</span> would crash on 32 bit
      architectures.  This has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>libvarnishapi</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Regex inclusion and exclusion had problems with matching
      particular parts of the string being matched.  This has been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
