    <h2>Changes between 2.1.1 and 2.1.2</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When adding <span class="code">Range</span> support for 2.1.1, we
      accidentially introduced a bug which would append garbage to
      objects larger than the chunk size, by default 128k. Browsers
      would do the right thing due to Content-Length, but some load
      balancers would get very confused.</p>
