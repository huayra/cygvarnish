    <h1>Change log for Varnish 1.0.4</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The request workflow has been redesigned to simplify
      request processing and eliminate code duplication.  All
      codepaths which need to speak HTTP now share a single
      implementation of the protocol.  Some new VCL hooks have been
      added, though they aren't much use yet.  The only real
      user-visible change should be that Varnish now handles
      persistent backend connections correctly (see <a href="http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/ticket/56">ticket #56</a>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Support for multiple listen addresses has been
      added.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An "include" facility has been added to VCL, allowing
      VCL code to pull in code fragments from multiple files.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Multiple definitions of the same VCL function are now
      concatenated into one in the order in which they appear in the
      source.  This simplifies the mechanism for falling back to the
      built-in default for cases which aren't handled in custom
      code, and facilitates modularization.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The code used to format management command arguments
      before passing them on to the child process would
      underestimate the amount of space needed to hold each argument
      once quotes and special characters were properly escaped,
      resulting in a buffer overflow.  This has been
      corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The VCL compiler has been overhauled.  Several memory
      leaks have been plugged, and error detection and reporting has
      been improved throughout.  Parts of the compiler have been
      refactored to simplify future extension of the
      language.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A bug in the VCL compiler which resulted in incorrect
      parsing of the decrement (<span class="code">-=</span>) operator has been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new <span class="code">-C</span> command-line option has been added
      which causes <span class="code">varnishd</span> to compile the VCL code
      (either from a file specified with <span class="code">-f</span> or the
      built-in default), print the resulting C code and exit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When processing a backend response using chunked
      encoding, if a chunk header crosses a read buffer boundary,
      read additional bytes from the backend connection until the
      chunk header is complete.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new <span class="code">ping_interval</span> run-time parameter
      controls how often the management process checks that the
      worker process is alive.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A bug which would cause the worker process to
      dereference a <span class="code">NULL</span> pointer and crash if the
      backend did not respond has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In some cases, such as when they are used by AJAX
      applications to circumvent Internet Explorer's over-eager disk
      cache, it may be desirable to cache <span class="code">POST</span>
      requests.  However, the code path responsible for delivering
      objects from cache would only transmit the response body when
      replying to a <span class="code">GET</span> request.  This has been
      extended to also apply to <span class="code">POST</span>.</p>
        <p>This should be revisited at a later date to allow VCL
      code to control whether the body is delivered.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish now respects <span class="code">Cache-control:
      s-maxage</span>, and prefers it to <span class="code">Cache-control:
      max-age</span> if both are present.</p>
        <p>This should be revisited at a later date to allow VCL
      code to control which headers are used and how they are
      interpreted.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When loading a new VCL script, the management process
      will now load the compiled object to verify that it links
      correctly before instructing the worker process to load
      it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new <span class="code">-P</span> command-line options has been
      added which causes <span class="code">varnishd</span> to create a PID
      file.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <span class="code">sendfile_threshold</span> run-time parameter's
      default value has been set to infinity after a variety of
      <span class="code">sendfile()</span>-related bugs were discovered on
      several platforms.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishlog</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When grouping log entries by request,
      <span class="code">varnishlog</span> attempts to collapse the log entry for
      a call to a VCL function with the log entry for the
      corresponding return from VCL.  When two VCL calls were made
      in succession, <span class="code">varnishlog</span> would incorrectly omit
      the newline between the two calls (see <a href="http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/ticket/95">ticket #95</a>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New <span class="code">-D</span> and <span class="code">-P</span> command-line
      options have been added to daemonize and create a pidfile,
      respectively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The flag that is raised upon reception of a
      <span class="code">SIGHUP</span> has been marked <span class="code">volatile</span> so it
      will not be optimized away by the compiler.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishncsa</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The formatting callback has been largely rewritten for
      clarity, robustness and efficiency.</p>
        <p>If a request included a <span class="code">Host:</span> header,
      construct and output an absolute URL.  This makes
      <span class="code">varnishncsa</span> output from servers which handle
      multiple virtual hosts far more useful.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The flag that is raised upon reception of a
      <span class="code">SIGHUP</span> has been marked <span class="code">volatile</span> so it
      will not be optimized away by the compiler.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The documentation—especially the VCL
      documentation—has been greatly extended and improved.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Build system</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The name and location of the <span class="code">curses</span> or
      <span class="code">ncurses</span> library is now correctly detected by the
      <span class="code">configure</span> script instead of being hardcoded into
      affected Makefiles.  This allows Varnish to build correctly on
      a wider range of platforms.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Compatibility shims for <span class="code">clock_gettime()</span> are
      now correctly applied where needed, allowing Varnish to build
      on MacOS X.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <span class="code">autogen.sh</span> script will now correctly
      detect and warn about <span class="code">automake</span> versions which are
      known not to work correctly.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
