      <para>Persistent storage is now experimentally supported using
      the <code>persistent</code> stevedore.  It has the same command
      line arguments as the file stevedore.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh">
      <para><code>obj.*</code> is now called <code>beresp.*</code>
      in <code>vcl_fetch</code>, and <code>obj.*</code> is now
      read-only.</para>
    </change>

      <para>The regular expression engine is now PCRE instead of POSIX
      regular expressions.</para>

      <para>Add saint mode where we can attempt to grace an object if
	we don't like the backend response for some reason.</para>

      <para>Related, add <code>saintmode_threshold</code> which is the
	threshold for the number of objects to be added to the trouble
	list before the backend is considered sick.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh">
      <para>Add a new hashing method called critbit.  This autoscales
      and should work better on large object workloads than the
      classic hash.  Critbit has been made the default hash algorithm.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh">
      <para>When closing connections, we experimented with sending RST
      to free up load balancers and free up threads more quickly.
      This caused some problems with NAT routers and so has been
      reverted for now.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh">
      <para>Add thread that checks objects against ban list in order
	to prevent ban list from growing forever.  Note that this
	needs purges to be written so they don't depend
	on <code>req.*</code>.  Enabled by
	setting <code>ban_lurker_sleep</code> to a nonzero
	value.</para>
    </change>

    <change type="enh">
      <para>The shared memory log file format was limited to maximum

	This may in some cases improve performance and is needed for
	persistence.</para>

    <change type="enh">
      <para>Remove client-side address accounting.  It was never used
      for anything and presented a performance problem.</para>
