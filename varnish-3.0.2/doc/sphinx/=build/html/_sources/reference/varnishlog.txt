SYNOPSIS
========

varnishlog [-a] [-b] [-C] [-c] [-D] [-d] [-I regex] [-i tag] [-k keep] 
[-n varnish_name] [-o] [-O] [-m tag:regex ...] [-P file] [-r file] [-s num] [-u] [-V]
[-w file] [-X regex] [-x tag]

DESCRIPTION
===========


The varnishlog utility reads and presents varnishd(1) shared memory logs.

The following options are available:

-a          When writing to a file, append to it rather than overwrite it.

-b          Include log entries which result from communication with a backend server.  
	    If neither -b nor -c is specified, varnishlog acts as if they both were.

-C          Ignore case when matching regular expressions.

-c          Include log entries which result from communication with a client.  
	    If neither -b nor -c is specified, varnishlog acts as if they both were.

-D          Daemonize.

-d          Process old log entries on startup.  Normally, varnishlog will only process entries 
	    which are written to the log after it starts.

-I regex    Include log entries which match the specified regular expression.  If 
   	    neither -I nor -i is specified, all log entries are included.

-i tag      Include log entries with the specified tag.  If neither -I nor -i is specified, 
   	    all log entries are included.

-k num      Only show the first num log records.

-m tag:regex only list transactions where tag matches regex. Multiple
            -m options are AND-ed together.  Can not be combined with -O

-n          Specifies the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from.  If -n is not 
	    specified, the host name is used.

-o          Ignored for compatibility with earlier versions.

-O          Do not group log entries by request ID.  Can not be
            combined with -m.

-P file     Write the process's PID to the specified file.

-r file     Read log entries from file instead of shared memory.

-s num      Skip the first num log records.

-u          Unbuffered output.

-V          Display the version number and exit.

-w file     Write log entries to file instead of displaying them.  The file 
   	    will be overwritten unless the -a option was specified. If 
	    varnishlog receives a SIGHUP while writing to a file, it will 
	    reopen the file, allowing the old one to be rotated away.

-X regex    Exclude log entries which match the specified regular expression.

-x tag      Exclude log entries with the specified tag.
