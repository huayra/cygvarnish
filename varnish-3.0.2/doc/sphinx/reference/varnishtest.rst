SYNOPSIS
========
     varnishtest [-n iter] [-q] [-v] file [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The varnishtest program is a script driven program used to test the
Varnish Cache.

The varnishtest program, when started and given one or more script
files, can create a number of threads representing backends, some
threads representing clients, and a varnishd process.

The following options are available:

-n iter     Run iter number of iterations.

-q          Be quiet.

-v          Be verbose.

-t          Dunno.

file        File to use as a script


SCRIPTS
=======

Example script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    # Start a varnish instance called "v1"
    varnish v1 -arg "-b localhost:9080" -start
    
    # Create a server thread called "s1"
    server s1 {
        # Receive a request
        rxreq
        # Send a standard response
        txresp -hdr "Connection: close" -body "012345\n"
    }
    
    # Start the server thread
    server s1 -start
    
    # Create a client thread called "c1"
    client c1 {
        # Send a request
        txreq -url "/"
        # Wait for a response
        rxresp
    # Insist that it be a success
    expect resp.status == 200
    }
    
    # Run the client
    client c1 -run
    
    # Wait for the server to die
    server s1 -wait

    # (Forcefully) Stop the varnish instance.
    varnish v1 -stop

Example script output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output, running this script looks as follows. The "bargraph" at
the beginning of the line is an indication of the level of detail in
the line. The second field where the message comes from. The rest of
the line is anyones guess :-)

If instead of 200 we had expected 201 with the line:::

  expect resp.status == 201

The output would have ended with:::

  #### c1  http[ 0] | HTTP/1.1
  #### c1  http[ 1] | 200
  #### c1  http[ 2] | Ok
  #### c1  http[ 3] | Content-Length: 9

  ---- c1  EXPECT resp.status (200) == 201 (201) failed
