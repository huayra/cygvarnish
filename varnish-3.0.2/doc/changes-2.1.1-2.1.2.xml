      <para>When adding <code>Range</code> support for 2.1.1, we
      accidentially introduced a bug which would append garbage to
      objects larger than the chunk size, by default 128k. Browsers
      would do the right thing due to Content-Length, but some load
      balancers would get very confused.</para>
