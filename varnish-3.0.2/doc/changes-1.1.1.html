    <h1>Change log for Varnish 1.1.1</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 1.1 and 1.1.1</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The code required to allow VCL to read
      <span class="code">obj.status</span>, which had accidentally been left out,
      has now been added.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish will now always include a <span class="code">Connection:</span>
      header in its reply to the client, to avoid possible
      misunderstandings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A bug that triggered an assertion failure when generating
      synthetic error documents has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new VCL function, <span class="code">purge_url</span>, provides the
      same functionality as the <span class="code">url.purge</span> management
      command.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Previously, Varnish assumed that the response body should
      be sent only if the request method was <span class="code">GET</span>.  This
      was a problem for custom request methods (such as
      <span class="code">PURGE</span>), so the logic has been changed to always
      send the response body except in the specific case of a
      <span class="code">HEAD</span> request.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changes to run-time parameters are now correctly
      propagated to the child process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Due to the way run-time parameters are initialized at
      startup, <span class="code">varnishd</span> previously required the
      <span class="code">nobody</span> user and the <span class="code">nogroup</span> group to
      exist even if a different user and group were specified on the
      command line.  This has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Under certain conditions, the VCL compiler would carry on
      after a syntax error instead of exiting after reporting the
      error.  This has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The manner in which the hash string is assembled has been
      modified to reduce memory usage and memory-to-memory
      copying.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Before calling <span class="code">vcl_miss</span>, Varnish assembles a
      tentative request object for the backend request which will
      usually follow.  This object would be leaked if
      <span class="code">vcl_miss</span> returned anything else than
      <span class="code">fetch</span>.  This has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The code necessary to handle an <span class="code">error</span> return
      from <span class="code">vcl_fetch</span> and <span class="code">vcl_deliver</span> had
      inadvertantly been left out.  This has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish no longer prints a spurious "child died" message
      (the result of reaping the compiler process) after compiling a
      new VCL configuration.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Under some circumstances, due to an error in the workspace
      management code, Varnish would lose the "tail" of a request,
      i.e. the part of the request that has been received from the
      client but not yet processed.  The most obvious symptom of this
      was that POST requests would work with some browsers but not
      others, depending on details of the browser's HTTP
      implementation.  This has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On some platforms, due to incorrect assumptions in the CLI
      code, the management process would crash while processing
      commands received over the management port.  This has been
      corrected.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Build system</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The top-level Makefile will now honor
      <span class="code">$DESTDIR</span> when creating the state directory.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Debian and RedHat packages are now split into three
      (main / lib / devel) as is customary.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A number of compile-time and run-time portability issues
      have been addressed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <span class="code">autogen.sh</span> script had workarounds for
      problems with the GNU autotools on FreeBSD; these are no longer
      needed and have been removed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <span class="code">libcompat</span> library has been renamed to
      <span class="code">libvarnishcompat</span> and is now dynamic rather than
      static.  This simplifies the build process and resolves an issue
      with the Mac OS X linker.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
