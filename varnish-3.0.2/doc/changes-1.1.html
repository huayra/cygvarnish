    <h1>Change log for Varnish 1.1</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 1.0.4 and 1.1</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Readability of the C source code generated from VCL code
      has been improved.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Equality (<span class="code">==</span>) and inequality
      (<span class="code">!=</span>) operators have been implemented for IP
      addresses (which previously could only be compared using
      ACLs).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The address of the listening socket on which the client
      connection was received is now available to VCL as the
      <span class="code">server.ip</span> variable.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each object's hash key is now computed based on a string
      which is available to VCL as <span class="code">req.hash</span>.  A VCL hook
      named <span class="code">vcl_hash</span> has been added to allow VCL scripts
      to control hash generation (for instance, whether or not to
      include the value of the <span class="code">Host:</span> header in the
      hash).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The setup code for listening sockets has been modified to
      detect and handle situations where a host name resolves to
      multiple IP addresses.  It will now attempt to bind to each IP
      address separately, and report a failure only if none of them
      worked.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Network or protocol errors that occur while retrieving an
      object from a backend server now result in a synthetic error
      page being inserted into the cache with a 30-second TTL.  This
      should help avoid driving an overburdened backend server into
      the ground by repeatedly requesting the same object.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The child process will now drop root privileges
      immediately upon startup.  The user and group to use are
      specified with the <span class="code">user</span> and <span class="code">group</span>
      run-time parameters, which default to <span class="code">nobody</span> and
      <span class="code">nogroup</span>, respectively.  Other changes have been
      made in an effort to increase the isolation between parent and
      child, and reduce the impact of a compromise of the child
      process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Objects which are received from the backend with a
      <span class="code">Vary:</span> header are now stored separately according to
      the values of the headers specified in <span class="code">Vary:</span>.  This
      allows Varnish to correctly cache e.g. compressed and
      uncompressed versions of the same object.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each Varnish instance now has a name, which by default is
      the host name of the machine it runs on, but can be any string
      that would be valid as a relative or absolute directory name.
      It is used to construct the name of a directory in which the
      server state as well as all temporary files are stored.  This
      makes it possible to run multiple Varnish instances on the same
      machine without conflict.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When invoked with the <span class="code">-C</span> option,
      <span class="code">varnishd</span> will now not just translate the VCL code
      to C, but also compile the C code and attempt to load the
      resulting shared object.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Attempts by VCL code to reference a variable outside its
      scope or to assign a value to a read-only variable will now
      result in compile-time rather than run-time errors.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The new command-line option <span class="code">-F</span> will make
      <span class="code">varnishd</span> run in the foreground, without enabling
      debugging.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>New VCL variables have been introduced to allow inspection
      and manipulation of the request sent to the backend
      (<span class="code">bereq.request</span>, <span class="code">bereq.url</span>,
      <span class="code">bereq.proto</span> and <span class="code">bereq.http</span>) and the
      response to the client (<span class="code">resp.proto</span>,
      <span class="code">resp.status</span>, <span class="code">resp.response</span> and
      <span class="code">resp.http</span>).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Statistics from the storage code (including the amount of
      data and free space in the cache) are now available to
      <span class="code">varnishstat</span> and other statistics-gathering
      tools.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Objects are now kept on an LRU list which is kept loosely
      up-to-date (to within a few seconds).  When cache runs out, the
      objects at the tail end of the LRU list are discarded one by one
      until there is enough space for the freshly requested object(s).
      A VCL hook, <span class="code">vcl_discard</span>, is allowed to inspect each
      object and determine its fate by returning either
      <span class="code">keep</span> or <span class="code">discard</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new VCL hook, <span class="code">vcl_deliver</span>, provides a
      chance to adjust the response before it is sent to the
      client.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new management command, <span class="code">vcl.show</span>, displays
      the VCL source code of any loaded configuration.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new VCL variable, <span class="code">now</span>, provides VCL scripts
      with the current time in seconds since the epoch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new VCL variable, <span class="code">obj.lastuse</span>, reflects the
      time in seconds since the object in question was last
      used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>VCL scripts can now add an HTTP header (or modify the
      value of an existing one) by assigning a value to the
      corresponding variable, and strip an HTTP header by using the
      <span class="code">remove</span> keyword.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>VCL scripts can now modify the HTTP status code of cached
      objects (<span class="code">obj.status</span>) and responses
      (<span class="code">resp.status</span>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Numeric and other non-textual variables in VCL can now be
      assigned to textual variables; they will be converted as
      needed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>VCL scripts can now apply regular expression substitutions
      to textual variables using the <span class="code">regsub</span>
      function.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new management command, <span class="code">status</span>, returns the
      state of the child.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish will now build and run on Mac OS X.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishadm</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This is a new utility which sends a single command to a
      Varnish server's management port and prints the result to
      <span class="code">stdout</span>, greatly simplifying the use of the
      management port from scripts.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishhist</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The user interface has been greatly improved; the
      histogram will be automatically rescaled and redrawn when the
      window size changes, and it is updated regularly rather than at
      a rate dependent on the amount of log data gathered.  In
      addition, the name of the Varnish instance being watched is
      displayed in the upper right corner.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishncsa</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In addition to client traffic, <span class="code">varnishncsa</span>
      can now also process log data from backend traffic.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A bug that would cause <span class="code">varnishncsa</span> to
      segfault when it encountered an empty HTTP header in the log
      file has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishreplay</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>This new utility will attempt to recreate the HTTP traffic
      which resulted in the raw Varnish log data which it is
      fed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishstat</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Don't print lifetime averages when it doesn't make any
      senseâ€”for instance, there is no point in dividing the
      amount in bytes of free cache space by the lifetime in seconds
      of the <span class="code">varnishd</span> process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The user interface has been greatly improved;
      <span class="code">varnishstat</span> will no longer print more than fits in
      the terminal, and will respond correctly to window resize
      events.  The output produced in one-shot mode has been modified
      to include symbolic names for each entry.  In addition, the name
      of the Varnish instance being watched is displayed in the upper
      right corner in curses mode.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishtop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The user interface has been greatly improved;
      <span class="code">varnishtop</span> will now respond correctly to window
      resize events, and one-shot mode (<span class="code">-1</span>) actually
      works.  In addition, the name of the Varnish instance being
      watched is displayed in the upper right corner in curses
      mode.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
