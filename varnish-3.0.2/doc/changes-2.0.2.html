    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.0.2</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In high-load situations, when using
      ESI, <span class="code">varnishd</span> would sometimes mishandle objects and
      crash.  This has been worked around. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishreplay</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishreplay</span> did not work correctly on
      Linux, due to a too small stack.  This has now been fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
