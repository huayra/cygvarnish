    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.1.5</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.1.4 and 2.1.5</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>On pass from vcl_recv, we did not remove the backends Content-Length
      header before adding our own. This could cause confusion for
      browsers and has been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make pass with content-length work again. An issue with regards
      to 304, Content-Length and pass has been resolved.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An issue relating to passed requests with If-Modified-Since
      headers has been fixed. Varnish did not recognize that the
      304-response did not have a body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A potential lock-inversion with the ban lurker thread has been
      resolved.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Several build-dependency issues relating to rst2man have been
      fixed. Varnish should now build from source without rst2man if you
      are using tar-balls.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure Varnish reads the expected last CRLF after chunked data
      from the backend. This allows re-use of the connection.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Remove a GNU Make-ism during <span class="code">make dist</span> to make BSD
      happier.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Document the log, set, unset, return and restart statements in
      the VCL documentation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Fix an embarrassingly old bug where Varnish would run out of
      workspace when requests come in fast over a single connection,
      typically during synthetic benchmarks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish will now allow <span class="code">If-Modified-Since</span> requests
      to objects without a <span class="code">Last-Modified</span>-header, and instead
      use the time the object was cached instead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Do not filter out <span class="code">Content-Range</span> headers in
      pass.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Require -d, -b, -f, -S or -T when starting Varnishd. In human
      terms, this means that it is legal to start varnishd without a Vcl or
      backend, but only if you have a CLI channel of some kind.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Don't suppress <span class="code">Cache-Control</span> headers in pass
      responses.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Merge multi-line Cache-Control and Vary header fields. Until
      now, no browsers have needed this, but Chromium seems to find it
      necessary to spread its Cache-Control across two lines, and we get to
      deal with it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make new-purge not touch busy objects. This fixes a potential
      crash when calling <span class="code">VRT_purge</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If there are everal grace-able objects, pick the least expired
      one.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Fix an issue with <span class="code">varnishadm -T :6082</span>
      shorthand.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add bourn-shell like "here" documents on the CLI. Typical
      usage:
      <span class="code">
      vcl.inline vcl_new &lt;&lt; 42
      backend foo {...}
      sub vcl_recv {...}
      42
      </span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add CLI version to the CLI-banner, starting with version 1.0 to
      mark here-documents.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Fix a problem with the expiry thread slacking off during high
      load.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishtest</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Remove no longer existing <span class="code">-L</span> option.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
