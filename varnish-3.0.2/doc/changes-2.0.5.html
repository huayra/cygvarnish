    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.0.5</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.0.4 and 2.0.5</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Handle object workspace overruns better.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allow turning off ESI processing per request by using
      <span class="code">set req.esi = off</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tell the kernel that we expect to use the mmap-ed file in
      a random fashion.  On Linux, this turns off/down readahead and
      increases performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make it possible to change the maximum number of HTTP
      headers we allow by
      passing <span class="code">--with-max-header-fields=NUM</span> rather than
      changing the code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Implement support for HTTP continuation lines.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Change how connections are closed and only use SO_LINGER
      for orderly connection closure.  This should hopefully make
      worker threads less prone to hangups on network problems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Handle multi-element purges correctly.  Previously we
      ended up with parse errors when this was done from VCL.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Handle illegal responses from the backend better by
      serving a 503 page rather than panic-ing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When we run into an assertion that is not true, Varnish
      would previously dump a little bit of information about itself.
      Extend that information with a backtrace.  Note that this relies
      on the varnish binary being unstripped.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a session_max parameter that limits the maximum
      number of sessions we keep open before we start dropping new
      connections summarily.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try to consume less memory when doing ESI processing by
      properly rolling back used workspace after processing an
      object.  This should make it possible to
      turn <span class="code">sess_workspace</span> quite a bit for users with
      ESI-heavy pages.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn on <span class="code">session_linger</span> by default.  Tests
      have shown that <span class="code">session_linger</span> helps a fair bit
      with performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rewrite the epoll acceptor for better performance.  This
      should lead to both higher processing rates and maximum number
      of connections on Linux.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add If-None-Match support, this gives significant
      bandwidth savings for users with compliant browsers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>RFC2616 specifies
      that <span class="code">ETag</span>, <span class="code">Content-Location</span>, <span class="code">Expires</span>, <span class="code">Cache-Control</span>
      and <span class="code">Vary</span> should be emitted when delivering a
      response with the 304 response code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Various fixes which makes Varnish compile and work on AIX.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn on TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT on Linux.  This should make us
      less suspecible to denial of service attacks as well as give us
      slightly better performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add an <span class="code">.initial</span> property to the backend
      probe specification.  This is the number of good probes we
      pretend to have seen.  The default is one less than .threshold,
      which means the first probe will decide if we consider the
      backend healthy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make it possible to compare strings against other
      string-like objects, not just plain strings.  This allows you to
      compare two headers, for instance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When support for <span class="code">restart</span>
      in <span class="code">vcl_error</span> was added, there was no check to
      prevent infinte recursion.  This has now been fixed.
     </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn on purge_dups by default.  This should make us
      consume less memory when there are many bans for the same
      pattern added.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a new log tag called <span class="code">FetchError</span> which
      tries to explain why we could not fetch an object from the
      backend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Change the default <span class="code">srcaddr_ttl</span> to 0.  It is
      not used by anything and has been removed in the development
      version.  This will increase performance somewhat.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishtop</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>varnishtop did not handle variable-length log fields
      correctly. This is now fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>varnishtop previously did not print the name of the tag,
      which made it very hard to understand.  We now print out the
      tag name.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
