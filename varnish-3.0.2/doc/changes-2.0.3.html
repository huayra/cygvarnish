    <h1>Change log for Varnish 2.0.3</h1>
    <h2>Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3</h2>
    <h3>varnishd</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Handle If-Modified-Since and ESI sub-objects better,
      fixing a problem where we sometimes neglected to insert
      included objects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">restart</span> in <span class="code">vcl_hit</span> is now supported.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Setting the TTL of an object to 0 seconds would sometimes
      cause it to be delivered for up to one second - epsilon.  This
      has been corrected and we should now never deliver those
      objects to other clients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The malloc storage backend now prints the maximum storage
      size, just like the file backend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Various small documentation bugs have been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish did not set a default interval for backend
      probes, causing it to poll the backend continuously.  This has
      been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allow "true" and "false" when setting boolean parameters,
      in addition to on/off, enable/disable and yes/no.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Default to always talking HTTP 1.1 with the backend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish did not make sure the file it was loading was a
      regular file.   This could cause Varnish to crash if it was
      asked to load a directory or other non-regular file.  We now
      check that the file is a regular file before loading it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The binary heap used for expiry processing had
      scalability problems.  Work around this by using stripes of a
      fixed size, which should make this scale better, particularly
      when starting up and having lots of objects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When we imported the <span class="code">jemalloc</span> library into
      the Varnish tree, it did not compile without warnings.  This
      has now been fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish took a very long time to detect that the backend
      did not respond.  To remedy this, we now have read timeouts in
      addition to the connect timeout.  Both
      the <span class="code">first_byte_timeout</span> and
      the <span class="code">between_bytes_timeout</span> defaults to 60 seconds.
      The connect timeout is no longer in milliseconds, but rather in
      seconds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Previously, the VCL to C conversion as well as the
      invocation of the C compiler was done in the management
      process.  This is now done in a separate sub-process.  This
      prevents any bugs in the VCL compiler from affecting the
      management process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chunked encoding headers were counted in the statistics
      for header bytes.  They no longer are.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ESI processed objects were not counted in the statistics
      for body bytes.  They now are.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is now possible to adjust the maximum record length of
      log entries in the shmlog by tuning the <span class="code">shm_reclen</span>
      parameter.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The management parameters listed in the CLI were not
      sorted, which made it hard to find the parameter you were
      looking for.  They are now sorted, which should make this
      easier.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Add a new hashing type, "critbit", which uses a lock-less
      tree based lookup algorithm.  This is experimental and should
      not be enabled in production environments without proper
      testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The session workspace had a default size of 8k.  It is
      now 16k, which should make VCLs where many headers are
      processed less prone to panics.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We have seen that people seem to be confused as to which
      actions in the different VCL functions return and which ones
      don't.  Add a new syntax <span class="code">return(action)</span> to make
      this more explicit.  The old syntax is still supported.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish would return an error if any of the management
      IPs listed in the <span class="code">-T</span> parameter could not be
      listened to.  We now only return an error if none of them can
      be listened to.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the case of the backend or client giving us too many
      parameters, we used to just ignore the overflowing headers.
      This is problematic if you end up ignoreing Content-Length,
      Transfer-Encoding and similar headers.  We now give out a 400
      error to the client if it sends us too many and 503 if we get
      too many from the backend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We used panic if we got a too large chunked header.
      This behaviour has been changed into just failing the
      transaction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish now supports an extended purge method where it is
      possible to do <span class="code">purge req.http.host ~ "web1.com" &amp;&amp; req.url ~ "\.png"
      </span> and similar.  See the documentation for details.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Under heavy load, Varnish would sometimes crash when
      trying to update the per-request statistics.  This has now been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is now possible to not save the hash string in the
      session and object workspace.  This will save a lot of memory
      on sites with many small objects.  Disabling
      the <span class="code">purge_hash</span> parameter also disables
      the <span class="code">purge.hash</span> facility.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish now supports <span class="code">!~</span> as a "no match"
      regular expression matcher.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In some cases, you could get serialised access to "pass"
      objects.  We now make it default to the default_ttl value; this
      can be overridden in vcl_fetch.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Varnish did not check the syntax of <span class="code">regsub</span>
      calls properly.  More checking has been added.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the client closed the connection while Varnish was
      processing ESI elements, Varnish would crash while trying to
      write the object to the client.  We now check if the client has
      closed the connection.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The ESI parser had a bug where it would crash if an XML
      comment would span storage segments.  This has been
      fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>VCL Manual page</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The documentation on how capturing parentheses work was
      wrong.  This has been corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Grace has now been documented.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>varnishreplay</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><span class="code">varnishreplay</span> did not work correctly on
      Linux, due to a too small stack.  This has now been fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
